    /**
     * cc.Node is the root class of all node. Anything that gets drawn or contains things that get drawn is a cc.Node.
     * The most popular cc.Nodes are: cc.Scene, cc.Layer, cc.Sprite, cc.Menu.
     *
     * The main features of a cc.Node are:
     * - They can contain other cc.Node nodes (addChild, getChildByTag, removeChild, etc)
     * - They can schedule periodic callback (schedule, unschedule, etc)
     * - They can execute actions (runAction, stopAction, etc)
     *
     * Some cc.Node nodes provide extra functionality for them or their children.
     *
     * Subclassing a cc.Node usually means (one/all) of:
     * - overriding constructor function "ctor" to initialize resources and schedule callbacks
     * - create callbacks to handle the advancement of time
     *
     * Features of cc.Node:
     * - position
     * - scale (x, y)
     * - rotation (in degrees, clockwise)
     * - anchor point
     * - size
     * - color
     * - opacity
     * - visible
     * - z-order
     * - WebGL z position
     *
     *  Default values:
     * - rotation: 0
     * - position: (x=0,y=0)
     * - scale: (x=1,y=1)
     * - contentSize: (x=0,y=0)
     * - anchorPoint: (x=0,y=0)
     * - color: (r=255,g=255,b=255)
     * - opacity: 255
     *
     *  Limitations:
     * - A cc.Node is a "void" object. It doesn't have a texture
     *
     * Order in transformations with grid disabled
     * -# The node will be translated (position)
     * -# The node will be rotated (rotation)
     * -# The node will be scaled (scale)
     *
     * Order in transformations with grid enabled
     * -# The node will be translated (position)
     * -# The node will be rotated (rotation)
     * -# The node will be scaled (scale)
     * -# The grid will capture the screen
     * -# The node will be moved according to the camera values (camera)
     * -# The grid will render the captured screen
